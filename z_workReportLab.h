/*
 * Features:
 *     -Not Implemented:
 *         N/A
 *     -Implemented:
 *         Lab/station seat reserver
 *         Lab/station seat validation
 *     -Partially Implemented:
 *         N/A
 *
 * Bugs:
 *     -No bugs
 *
 * Reflections:
 *     -I had trouble editing the logic of my is_valid(), but once I got
 *     that down the rest of the program flowed smoothly. I didn't
 *     include "invalid at x location" when login is unsuccessful
 *     because the user could have multiple situations where
 *     there is an unsuccessful login for different reasons
 *     (seat taken, invalid ID, invalid seat, etc)
